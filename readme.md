# Speech Recognition with NLTK and SpeechRecognition

This Python application demonstrates speech recognition using NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit) for text processing and SpeechRecognition library for capturing and transcribing speech from a microphone using PyAudio.

## Installation

To use this application, you'll need to install the required Python libraries:

1. **NLTK**: Install NLTK using pip:
   ```
   pip install nltk
   ```

2. **PyAudio**: Install PyAudio using pip:
   ```
   pip install pyaudio
   ```

3. **SpeechRecognition**: Install SpeechRecognition using pip:
   ```
   pip install SpeechRecognition
   ```

## Usage

1. **Capture and Transcribe Speech**: Run the Python script `input.py` to capture audio from the microphone and transcribe it into text using Google's speech recognition service.

   ```
   python input.py
   ```

2. **Text Processing with NLTK**: After transcribing the speech, you can use NLTK for various text processing tasks on the transcribed text within the same script or in subsequent processing steps.

   ```python
   import nltk

   # Tokenize the transcribed text
   tokens = nltk.word_tokenize(transcribed_text)
   ```

   You can perform various NLP tasks such as tokenization, part-of-speech tagging, and more using NLTK.

## Additional Notes

- **Microphone Input**: Ensure that your system's microphone is properly configured and accessible by PyAudio for capturing audio input.

- **Internet Connection**: SpeechRecognition library requires an active internet connection to interact with Google's speech recognition service for transcribing speech.

- **Language Support**: By default, SpeechRecognition uses Google's service, which supports multiple languages. However, ensure that the language spoken into the microphone is supported by Google's service.

## Future Enhancements

This application can be further extended to include additional features or integrated into a web application for remote speech recognition. Future enhancements may include:

- Implementing error handling and graceful exits for various scenarios, such as microphone not detected or network errors during speech recognition.
- Building a web interface to allow users to interact with the speech recognition functionality remotely.
- Adding support for multiple languages and custom language models for improved speech recognition accuracy.
